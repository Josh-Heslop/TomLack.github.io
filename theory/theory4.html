                <h2>Chapter 11 - Data Types</h2>
                <h3>Base 10</h3>
				<p>The base 10 number system is called Denary, and it is what most people think of numbers as in the western world. What is meant by the number system
				being base 10, is that there are 10 characters to represent numbers, for denary, these are 0-9. Once we have reached the number 9 and want to add one more
				we just set the first column to 0, and set the next highest column to 1.</p>
				<h3>Base 2</h3>
				<p>The base 2 number system is called Binary, and it is what computers understand. Sometimes people find it hard to understand how binary works because
				they don't see how the denary system works in a way that would make it easy to. For the binary system, there are two characters to represent numbers, 0 and 1.
				Binary is used in computers because that 0 or 1 represents off or on so numbers can be represented with the flow of electricity.</p>
				<h3>Base 16</h3>
				<p>The base 26 number system is called Hexadecimal, and it is what is commonly used to display numbers to a person rather than binary since it is easier to see
				a bunch of letters and numbers and understand what it means rather than a load of 1s and zeros. Haxadecimal and binary have a special connection between them when
				when converting them since each nibble (four bits) corresponds to one character of hexadecimal. For the hexadecimal system, there are 16 characters to represent
				numbers, 0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,A,B,C,D,E and F.</p>
				<h3>Converting Between Binary and Denary</h3>
				<p>To convert a number from binary to denary, you must add up all the numbers from the columns that have 1s in them, for example in 00010011 you add up 16+2+1 to get 19.
				To convert back to binary you can use the dividing method where you take the denary number, for example 27, and divide it by two, if there is a remainder then set the first
				column to 1 and then repeat moving up the columns form right to left until you have nothing left. If there is no remainder then set the number to 0. For the example of
				27 it would be 11011</p>
				<h3>Converting Between Binary and Hexadecimal</h3>
				<p>To change from binary to hexadecimal you take each nibble and find what value that nibble is worth on its own. For example your first nibble might be 1010. This
				equals 10 in denary so we assign that nibble the character A (since A represents 10 in hexadecimal) and move onto the next nibble. To go from hexadecimal to binary
				we just do the inverse, taking each character, finding it's value, and finding how that is represented in binary as a nibble.</p>
				<h3>Converting Between Denary and Hexadecimal</h3>
				<p>Converting from denary to hexadecimal is done in the similar way we converted denary to binary. We do it by dividing the number by 16 this time and put the remainder
				in the '1's column. Then we take the number we have left after dividing and repeat the process moving up the hexadecimal number. In order to convert back to denary we just
				times each character by what that column represents. For example the 'F' in 'F7' is in the 16 coloumn and represents 15, when these are timesed it makes 240. Then we add on the
				next character which in the example is in the 1 column so it is just worth 7 and when added on this makes 247.</p>
